<p>Inspiration: As enrolled Bellevue College students, we have gone through the process of applying and attending. We know the ins and outs of how the college process works, and we wanted to ease that process for students like us. It starts by giving students access to all the resources, college information, and advice in one place. That is why we built this portal.</p>
<p>Purpose: It will provide resources and links to get students prepared for college. Students can access essential information before they attend, and it will help streamline the transition from acceptance to official enrollment at Bellevue College by providing clear next steps. The portal will be designed to answer questions and encourage students to commit to the school.</p>
<p>Relevancy: This project is relevant because students struggle every year with misinformation on the web about information pertaining to a college. Our idea offers a clear and concise way for prospective BC students to access resources and information. This population of students is in the thousands each year, making it highly relevant.</p>
